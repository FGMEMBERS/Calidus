The purpose of this model is to test the use of JSBSim's FGRotor 
class, for use in a gyrocopter.  So far I can't get it to work well.

Instructions:

    1) Start engine (s key)
    2) Pre-rotate rotor (j key) to 190-200 rpm
    3) Release parking brake (shift-b)
    4) Increase throttle and go
       (you'll need lots of forward stick after liftoff)    
    5) crash :( 

    6) Engage rotor brake (k key)
